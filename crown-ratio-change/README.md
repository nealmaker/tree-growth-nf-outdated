Crown ratio change model for trees in the Northern Forest

This model is poorly developed now, and has not been tested against independent data yet.

## To Do:

* More exploritory analysis
* Better lit review
  * Have others modeled this before?
  * What factors should I expect to be important?
  * What is an acceptable outcome in terms of accuracy?
  * How sensitive will growth & yield models be to CR change (does it matter much)?
* Exploration of other model types
