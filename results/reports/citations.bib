	abstract = {One of the pivotal objectives in forestry research is to estimate the response of silvicultural target variables to climate change scenarios at high temporal resolution in order to consider within-year feedbacks between growth and environmental conditions. To meet this challenge, models are needed which support and complement the widely used observation-based decision systems in forest management and consulting. Physiological models in particular provide the fundamental prerequisites to reflect the impact of various simultaneously changing environmental conditions. However, a physiological representation at the individual tree level is computationally very expensive and sensitive to uncertain initializations. We thus propose an approach that combines a modern representative of the physiological cohort model type, MoBiLE-PSIM, with the individual tree competition concept of a distance-dependent empirical growth simulator (SILVA). The resulting hybrid provides a key feature for the consideration of forest management in long-term simulations at high computational efficiency. The extended model was evaluated with growth-diameter distributions obtained from core-boring at two beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest sites in south-west Germany that differ in exposure and soil conditions. The mean bias of annual stand-scale growth from 2001 to 2007 decreased from −0.59 to −0.41 mm at one evaluation plot and from −0.55 to −0.24 mm at the other when the competition module was coupled in. Inclusion of the SILVA-based individual tree module into MoBiLE-PSIM improved the size-dependent representation of competition and growth on five-year and even annual timescale. This was particularly the case where the spatial distribution of dominant trees was clustered.},

	abstract = {• It is widely believed that distance-independent tree models fail to take into account the complexity of mixed stands due to the fact that spatial structure often has a greater impact on growth and dynamics in mixed stands than in pure stands. On the other hand, distance-dependent tree models are difficult to use because they require a map of the stand, which is not only very costly but also impracticable in a routine management context.• This paper reports the development of a model bridging distance-dependent and distance-independent tree models, and that is designed to simulate the growth of a mixed forest. The model used distributions of the number of neighbours to reconstruct tree neighbourhoods and compute the competition indices needed as inputs to the growth model. • Data were collected from a mixed forest of sessile oak and Scots pine in central France. The study showed that local competition indices explained a significant proportion of growth variability and that intraspecific competition was greater than interspecific competition. The model based on neighbourhood distributions gave consistent predictions compared to a distance-dependent model.• This type of model could be used instead of distance-dependent models in management contexts., • On considère généralement que les modèles arbre indépendant des distances ne permettent pas de rendre compte de la complexité des peuplements mélangés. En effet, la structure spatiale a souvent un rôle plus important sur la croissance et la dynamique dans ces peuplements que dans les peuplements purs. Les modèles arbre dépendant des distances sont quant à eux difficile à utiliser, car ils nécessitent une cartographie du peuplement qui est une information très coûteuse à obtenir et qui n’est pas disponible dans un cadre de gestion courante.• Cet article présente un modèle intermédiaire entre un modèle arbre indépendant des distances et un modèle arbre dépendant des distances. Ce modèle a été développé pour simuler la croissance de peuplements mélangés. Il utilise des distributions de nombre de voisins pour reconstruire le voisinage des arbres. Ces voisinages reconstruits permettent ensuite de calculer les indices de compétition nécessaires dans l’équation de croissance.• Les données ont été récoltées dans des peuplements mélangés de chêne sessile et de pin sylvestre dans le centre de la France. Ce travail montre que des indices de compétition locaux expliquent une part significative de la croissance individuelle et que la compétition intraspécifique est supérieure à la compétition interspécifique. Le modèle basé sur les distributions de voisinage donne des prédictions cohérentes par rapport au modèle arbre dépendant des distances.• Ce type de modèle pourrait être utilisé à la place des modèles arbre dépendant des distances dans des contextes de gestion.},

Data were collected from 221 destructively sampled trees in eight second-growth stands on above-average sites. The single best independent variable for predicting basal area growth was the projection area of the exposed portion of the crown, which had higher correlations with observed growth than initial stem diameter, diameter-based competition indices, and other crown variables. Basal area growth equations containing total crown projection area, percent exposed crown area, and relative height had R2 values ranging from 0.77 to 0.88, which represent increases of 13 to 47 percentage points compared with similar equations with only diameter-based competition variables. The most accurate height growth models were functions of total tree height and percent exposed crown area, with R2 values of 0.74 for the non-linear maple equation and 0.44 for the linear white ash equation. The results appear to support the hypothesis that significant competitive stress on individual trees is induced only by the ring of competitor trees immediately surrounding the subject tree crown. By using percent exposed crown area as a crown competition variable, this competitive effect can be estimated without direct measurements of any of the competitors, potentially saving much field measurement time during the model calibration phase and eliminating the statistical lack of independence generally associated with plot competition measures.},

	abstract = {Forest gap models, initially conceived in 1969 as a special case of individual-tree based models, have become widely popular among forest ecologists for addressing a large number of applied research questions, including the impacts of global change on long-term dynamics of forest structure, biomass, and composition. However, they have been strongly criticized for a number of weaknesses inherent in the original model structure. In this paper, I review the fundamental assumptions underlying forest gap models, the structure of the parent model JABOWA, and examine these criticisms in the context of the many alternative formulations that have been developed over the past 30 years.Four assumptions originally underlie gap models: (1) The forest is abstracted as a composite of many small patches of land, where each can have a different age and successional stage; (2) patches are horizontally homogeneous, i.e., tree position within a patch is not considered; (3) the leaves of each tree are located in an indefinitely thin layer (disk) at the top of the stem; and (4) successional processes are described on each patch separately, i.e., there are no interactions between patches. These simplifications made it possible to consider mixed-species, mixed-age forests, which had been difficult previously mainly because of computing limitations.The structure of JABOWA is analysed in terms of the functional relationships used for formulating the processes of tree establishment, growth, and mortality. It is concluded that JABOWA contains a number of unrealistic assumptions that have not been questioned strongly to date. At the same time, some aspects of JABOWA that were criticized strongly in the past years are internally consistent given the objectives of this specific model.A wide variety of formulations for growth processes, establishment, and mortality factors have been developed in gap models over the past 30 years, and modern gap models include more robust parameterizations of environmental influences on tree growth and population dynamics as compared to JABOWA. Approaches taken in more recent models that led to the relaxation of one or several of the four basic assumptions are discussed. It is found that the original assumptions often have been replaced by alternatives; however, no systematic analysis of the behavioral effects of these conceptual changes has been attempted to date.The feasibility of including more physiological detail (instead of using relatively simple parameterizations) in forest gap models is discussed, and it is concluded that we often lack the data base to implement such approaches for more than a few commercially important tree species. Hence, it is important to find a compromise between using simplistic parameterizations and expanding gap models with physiology-based functions and parameters that are difficult to estimate. While the modeling of tree growth has received a lot of attention over the past years, much less effort has been spent on improving the formulations of tree establishment and mortality, although these processes are likely to be just as sensitive to global change as tree growth itself. Finally, model validation issues are discussed, and it is found that there is no single data source that can reliably be used for evaluating the behavior of forest gap models; instead, I propose a combination of sensitivity analyses, qualitative examinations of process formulations, and quantitative tests of gap models or selected submodels against various kinds of empirical data to evaluate the usefulness of these models for assessing their utility for predicting the impacts of global change on long-term forest dynamics.},

	abstract = {A density-dependent matrix model of stand growth is presented. The model was calibrated with re-measured plots in the northern hardwood forests in Wisconsin. Trees were divided into shade-tolerant, intermediate, and shade-intolerant species in twelve diameter classes. Model predictions were tested against post-sample observations for short-term (15-year) and long-term (steady-state) accuracy. This growth model was then applied to study stand growth dynamics with and without management. Starting with the current average stand state, the predicted stand basal area of an unmanaged stand rose steadily to a maximum, dropped gradually, and finally reached a steady state. The time paths of basal area and tree size diversity were highly and positively correlated. Instead, tree species diversity decreased when size diversity and basal area increased, and vice-versa. When harvesting was introduced, it was found that more intensive harvest increased the diversity of tree species, while decreasing the diversity of tree size. A 20-year cutting cycle could produce higher economic returns than a 10-year cutting cycle, with similar size and species diversity. Harvesting most of the saw timbers every 20 years could be a good compromise between economics and tree diversity, at the stand level.},

	abstract = {Plant interactions can be defined as the ways plants act upon the growth, fitness, survival and reproduction of other plants, largely by modifying their environment. These interactions can be positive (facilitation) or negative (competition or exploitation). During plantation establishment or natural forest regeneration after a disturbance, high light levels and, sometimes, increased availability of water and nutrients favour the development of opportunistic, fast-growing herbaceous and woody species which capture resources at the expense of crop trees. As a consequence, the growth and survival of crop trees can be dramatically reduced. Although the effects of this competition are well documented, the physical and physiological mechanisms of competition are not. Moreover, the competition process is never constant in time or space. We present a conceptual competition model based on plant growth forms common in global forests, i.e. graminoids, forbs, small shrubs, large shrubs and mid-storey trees, and main-storey trees. Their competitive attributes and successional dynamics are examined. An overview is presented on the way forest vegetation management (FVM) treatments influence these components and outcomes regarding crop tree performance and diversity conservation. Finally, a synthesis of literature yields FVM guidelines for efficiently optimizing crop tree performance and safeguarding diversity. Future research needs to further sustainable FVM are presented.},

Because residual tree growth is affected by tree removal, growth simulators must be coupled with a harvest model to adequately predict future stand development. Harvest models may consider variables such as species, diameter at breast height (DBH), spatial coordinates of the trees and indicators of stem quality and vigour. Through the development of a harvest model applicable to selection cuttings in northern hardwood stands, we aimed to quantify the loss of accuracy caused by the omission of either tree spatial coordinates or tree quality/vigour descriptors from the predictor variables. Spatial correlations were handled using both generalized linear mixed-effect models and a copula approach. Tree vigour and quality were assessed using three different classification systems used in practice. The inclusion of tree vigour and spatial correlations through the copula approach led to a 12 per cent improvement in maximum log-likelihood. However, the inclusion of the spatial coordinates of each tree only accounted for one quarter of this 12 per cent. In cases where a growth simulator uses tree vigour class as input, we recommend the inclusion of this variable in the associated harvest sub-model.},

This hypothesis was tested in this study.• Material and methodsWe used a single-tree growth model that can be implemented either stochastically or deterministically. Two data sets of 186 and 342 plots each were used for the comparisons. For each plot, the simulations were run on a 100-year period using 10-year growth steps. Three different response variables were compared.• ResultsThe results showed that there were differences between the predictions from stochastic and deterministic simulations for some response variables and that randomness alone could not explain these differences. In the case of deterministic simulations, the fact that predictions are reinserted into the model at each growth step is a concern. These predictions are actually random variables and their transformations may result in biased quantities. Forest growth modellers should be aware that deterministic simulations may not correspond to the mathematical expectation of the natural dynamics.},

Stem quality generally improved with d.b.h. and stand basal area. Changes in hardwood stem quality were strongly related to initial stem quality, with most trees retaining their initial quality over time.

Using these classes can simplify the tree selection process, but some classification systems may include superfluous classes beyond what is required to explain the variation in tree value. In this paper, we present a parsimonious classification system for sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) trees using formal classification analyses of empirical product recovery data. We also calculated the net value of trees in each class and assessed which defects affect tree value. Our results show that relatively few defects affect tree value, indicating that treemarkers should use a simpler classifica..., Dans les forêts de feuillus nordiques, les marteleurs sont responsables du choix des arbres à prélever lors des opérations commerciales de récolte. Ils choisissent souvent les arbres en fonction de la présence et de la gravité des défauts; cette information est ensuite utilisée pour assigner les arbres à deux ou plusieurs classes de vigueur (reflétant le risque de mortalité ou de déclin de la croissance) et à deux ou plusieurs classes de qualité (reflétant la possibilité de prélever des billes de sciage de valeur). L’utilisation de ces classes peut simplifier le processus de sélection des arbres, mais certains systèmes de classification peuvent inclure des classes superflues qui vont au-delà de ce qui est nécessaire pour expliquer la variation de la valeur des arbres.

	abstract = {The raw material properties of wood develop as the tree grows, laying down wood cells with specific properties, and forming the stem structure that is the basis of timber quality. This development is influenced by genetic and environmental factors and forest management practices. It is desirable in growth and yield models intended for the economic assessment of management practices to include some indication of wood quality and how it is affected by genetics, environmental factors and silvicultural measures. In forestry, understanding the development and variation of wood quality is important for different management and planning problems which can be broadly classified under (1) management for harvest operations, and (2) long-term silvicultural planning. This paper reviews approaches and models that allow us to study these two problems in quantitative terms. We start the review by discussing the concept of «wood quality model», then classify the approaches on the basis of their complexity, underlying principle and intended application. We illustrate three advanced dynamic quality models and their applications with example case studies. These include empirical, hybrid, and mechanistic models applied to predictions of both sawn timber and fibre properties. Finally, we consider the current challenges for wood quality modelling in connection with forest management.},

	abstract = {Global climate is changing due to increasing anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. Forest managers need growth and yield models that can be used to predict future forest dynamics during the transition period of present-day forests under a changing climatic regime. In this study, we developed a forest growth and yield model that can be used to predict individual-tree growth under current and projected future climatic conditions. The model was constructed by integrating historical tree growth records with predictions from an ecological process-based model using neural networks. The new model predicts basal area (BA) and volume growth for individual trees in pure or mixed species forests. For model development, tree-growth data under current climatic conditions were obtained using over 3000 permanent sample plots from the Province of Nova Scotia, Canada. Data to reflect tree growth under a changing climatic regime were projected with JABOWA-3 (an ecological process-based model). Model validation with designated data produced model efficiencies of 0.82 and 0.89 in predicting individual-tree BA and volume growth. Model efficiency is a relative index of model performance, where 1 indicates an ideal fit, while values lower than zero means the predictions are no better than the average of the observations. Overall mean prediction error (BIAS) of basal area and volume growth predictions was nominal (i.e., for BA: -0.0177 cm2 5-year-1 and volume: 0.0008 m3 5-year-1). Model variability described by root mean squared error (RMSE) in basal area prediction was 40.53 cm2 5-year-1 and 0.0393 m3 5-year-1 in volume prediction. The new modelling approach has potential to reduce uncertainties in growth and yield predictions under different climate change scenarios. This novel approach provides an avenue for forest managers to generate required information for the management of forests in transitional periods of climate change. Artificial intelligence technology has substantial potential in forest modelling.},

	abstract = {Empirical growth and yield models developed from historical data are commonly used in developing long-term strategic forest management plans. Use of these models rests on an assumption that there will be no future change in the tree growing environment. However, major impacts on forest growing conditions are expected to occur with climate change. As a result, there is a pressing need for tools capable of incorporating outcomes of climate change in their predictions of forest growth and yield. Process-based models have this capability and may, therefore, help to satisfy this requirement. In this paper, we evaluate the suitability of an ecological, individual-tree-based model (JABOWA-3) in generating forest growth and yield projections for diverse forest conditions across Nova Scotia, Canada. Model prediction accuracy was analyzed statistically by comparing modelled with observed basal area and merchantable volume changes for 35 permanent sample plots (PSPs) measured over periods of at least 25 years. Generally, modelled basal area and merchantable volume agreed fairly well with observed data, yielding coefficients of determination (r2) of 0.97 and 0.94 and model efficiencies (ME) of 0.96 and 0.93, respectively. A Chi-square test was performed to assess model accuracy with respect to changes in species composition. We found that 83\% of species-growth trajectories based on measured basal area were adequately modelled with JABOWA-3 (P {\textgreater} 0.9). Model-prediction accuracy, however, was substantially reduced for those PSPs altered by some level of disturbance. In general, JABOWA-3 is much better at providing forest yield predictions, subject to the availability of suitable climatic and soil information.},

	abstract = {Forest growth simulators go beyond a mere tabulation of empirical measurements by employing biometric models that functionally describe the dependence of forest growth of the initial forest structure, growth conditions and management regime. This makes them very flexible and allows predicting growth reactions for unknown and/or complex forest growth scenarios. When simulation outcomes are to be used in silvicultural strategic planning, the results are of direct and delicate importance, and the correct simulator performance must be ascertained. This is especially so when the considered forest situation differs from the forest data used to parameterise the model (e.g. different geographical region). In this article, the forest growth simulator SILVA (version 2.2) was validated for 55 long-term experimental plots of mature mixed Silver fir–Norway spruce stands in southwest Germany (Picea abies, Abies alba). The evaluation was restricted to the upper canopy trees during the survey period 1989–2004. Following the general evaluation criteria for ecological models from [Vanclay, J.K., Skovsgaard, J.P., 1997. Evaluating forest growth models. Ecol. Mod. 98, 1–12], a specific methodology was developed to evaluate the simulated height and diameter growth on the basis of forest growth principles. The qualitative analysis proved the SILVA growth algorithms to be in accordance with physiologically based standard growth equations. The quantitative evaluation was limited by incomplete knowledge of the site conditions. To overcome this problem, the experimental plots were regarded as a “heterogeneous growth series” which allows analysing the growth behaviour in a more general way. It could be shown that for the given data set, the SILVA simulations produced an overestimation of height growth (median: +61\% spruce, +12\% fir), and an underestimation of diameter growth and competition sensitivity (median: −16\% spruce, −70\% fir). The errors partially compensated in the volume growth resulting in an overall over-/underestimation of +9\% for spruce and −58\% for fir (median). The unbalanced height and diameter growth cannot be compensated by a change in the site conditions because this affects both height and diameter growth either positive or negative. Hence, an adjustment of selected parameterisation values appears to offer the best solution to adapt SILVA to the considered forest situation. This approach of adaptive parameterisation is discussed against a more general background of deductive vs. inductive forest growth modelling.},

They are commonly applied in the United States but they are rarely used in European forest management yet. One of the few exceptions is the simulator SILVA, which is presented in this paper. The underlying equations of this simulator are developed from a set of more than 155,000 tree observations, including the species Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl.). These basic model equations are presented together with respective parameter values, derived from the aforesaid data set. The benefits of SILVA for forest practice, research, and education are demonstrated with three exemplary applications. Evaluation in terms of biological plausibility, validation, and practical use of the implemented software is presented, which shows that: (1) biological principles could be represented without explicitly being implemented, and (2) the simulation results are very close to independent observations as far as the range of parameterized site conditions is not exceeded. Furthermore, possible implications of changing conditions or an application of the model across a wider geographical range are discussed with special reference to the ongoing process of parameterization.},

	abstract = {With a view toward understanding species-specific differences in juvenile tree mortality and the community-level implications of these differences, we characterized juvenile survivorship of 10 dominant tree species of oak transition-northern hardwood forests using species-specific mathematical models. The mortality models predict a sapling's probability of dying as a function of its recent growth history. These models and species-specific growth functions (published elsewhere), characterize a species' shade tolerance. Combined growth and mortality models express a sapling's probability of mortality as a function of light availability. We describe the statistical bases and the field methods used to calibrate the mortality models. We examined inter- and intraspecific variation in juvenile mortality across three sites: Great Mountain Forest (low pH, nutrient poor soils) in northwestern Connecticut, a calcareous bedrock region (neutral pH, nutrient rich soils) also in northwestern Connecticut, and a site in central-western Michigan (low pH, nutrient poor soils). Interspecific differences in juvenile mortality have profound effects on community dynamics and composition; the importance of these effects is demonstrated through a spatially explicit simulator of forest dynamics (SORTIE). The 10 species we examined occupy a continuum of survivorship levels at 1\% of full sun. There was surprisingly little intraspecific variation in mortality functions for sugar maple, American beech, eastern hemlock, and white ash between the Great Mountain and Michigan sites. However, there was a striking increase in survivorship for sugar maple in the calcareous site. Differences in survivorship among the sites are correlated with soil pH and presumably nutrient availability. Growth rates in high-light and low-light survivorship are inversely correlated across species; as level of shade tolerance increases, a species grows more slowly in high light and exhibits increased survivorship under low light. Our results indicate that interspecific differences in sapling mortality are critical components of forest community dynamics.},

	abstract = {We present a critical review of current trends in research of spatio-temporal development of forests. The paper addresses (1) field methods for the development of spatially-explicit models of forest dynamics and their integration in models of forest dynamics, (2) strengths and limitations of traditional patch models versus spatiallyexplicit, individual-based models, and (3) the potential for moment-based methods in the analysis of forest dynamics. These topics are discussed with reference to their potential for solving open questions in the studies of forest dynamics. The study of spatio-temporal processes provides a link between pattern and process in plant communities, and plays a crucial role in understanding ecosystem dynamics. In the last decade, the development of spatially-explicit, individual-based models shifted the focus of forest dynamics modelling from the dynamics of discrete patches to the interactions among individual organisms, thus encapsulating the theory of ‘‘neighbourhood’’ dynamics. In turn, the stochastic properties and the complexity of spatially-explicit, individual-based models gave rise to the development of a new suite of so-called moment-based models. These new models describe the dynamics of individuals and of pairs of individuals in terms of their densities, thus directly capturing second-order information on spatial structure. So far, this approach has not been applied to forests; we indicate extensions needed for such applications. Moment-based models may be an important complement to spatially explicit individual-based models in developing a general spatial theory of forest dynamics. However, both kinds of models currently focus on fine scales, whereas a critical issue in forest dynamics is to understand the interaction of fine-scale processes with coarser-scale disturbances. To obtain a more complete picture of forest dynamics, the relevant links and interactions between fine-, intermediate-, and coarse-scale processes ought to be identified. Intensive links between modelling work and field studies designed across different scales are a promising means to create a new perspective on forest dynamics.},

	abstract = {The belief that canopy gaps are important for the maintenance of tree species diversity appears to be widespread, but there have been no formal theoretical models to assess under what conditions gap phase processes allow coexistence. Much of the empirical research on niche diff erentiation in response to gaps has focused on evidence for an interspecific tradeoff between low light survival and high light growth. The objectives of this study are first to distinguish the possible mechanisms allowing coexistence based on this tradeoff, and second, to explore their limitations. We present a theory of forest dynamics driven by small-scale disturbances as a special case of the theory of coexistence in variable environments. We demonstrate that temporal and spatial heterogeneity in light conditions that results from canopy gaps can allow stable coexistence as a result of three previously documented general mechanisms: ‘relative non-linearity’, ‘the successional niche’ and the ‘storage eff ect’. We find that temporal fluctuations in light availability alone allow the stable coexistence of only two species. Spatial variation in disturbance synchronicity and intensity allows three species to coexist in a narrow parameter space. The rate of extinction is, however, extremely slow and there is transient coexistence of a larger number of species for a long period of time. We conclude that while the low light survival/high light growth tradeoff may be ubiquitous in forest tree species, it is unlikely to function as an important mechanism for the stable coexistence of several tree species.},

To conserve forest complexity and biodiversity, silviculture and forest management should change the reference paradigm and consider forest ecosystems as complex biological systems characterized by the inherent unpredictability of their trajectories in a continuously changing environment. The new Management Plan for the Vallombrosa Forest (Florence, Italy), a State Nature Reserve and a Natura 2000 Site, is based on this approach. The aim is the gradual evolution of the pure silver fir stands toward mixed stands with a complex structure. Most of the species considered by Natura 2000 depend on an increase of structural diversity at different space and time scales. The management approach proposed by the new plan is coherent with this aim and thus biodiversity conservation is not in conflict with forest management but is, instead, a direct consequence of the systemic approach.},

A common global trend in forestry is development of new silvicultural approaches as alternatives to plantation forestry that bear names that include the words ‘nature’, ‘ecological’ or some other positive expression regarding their intent or effects. Some approaches are attempting to emulate natural processes and others to minimize disturbance effects in an attempt to be more natural. In any case, the effects of climate changes, non-native plants, insects, pathogens and animals, and other anthropogenic effects are creating novel forest ecosystems where the silviculture of the past may not be appropriate. It should be recognized that forestry has always attempted to manage stands to meet objectives in ways that would not be similarly met without management. Rather than acquiescing to pressures to follow a nature-based model based on the past, we need to recognize that our forest ecosystems are changing and the rate of change may accelerate in the future. Natural processes and stand structures are important information about natural systems, but not necessarily for the management of these changing systems. Management of these novel ecosystems to meet societal needs will have to be novel. Rather than striving to be close to a nature that is under constant change, silviculture should strive to be better than nature. ‘Close-to-nature’ is flawed in both its intent to emulate nature and as a means to meet shifting ecological conditions and societal needs.},

In this review, we identify and evaluate six principles for enhancing the adaptive capacity of European temperate forests in a changing climate: (1) increase tree species richness, (2) increase structural diversity, (3) maintain and increase genetic variation within tree species, (4) increase resistance of individual trees to biotic and abiotic stress, (5) replace high-risk stands and (6) keep average growing stocks low. We use these principles to examine how three CNS systems (single-tree selection, group selection and shelterwood) serve adaptation strategies. Many attributes of CNS can increase the adaptive capacity of European temperate forests to a changing climate. CNS promotes structural diversity and tree resistance to stressors, and growing stocks can be kept at low levels. However, some deficiencies exist in relation to the adaptation principles of increasing tree species richness, maintaining and increasing genetic variation, and replacing high-risk stands. To address these shortcomings, CNS should make increased use of a range of regeneration methods, in order to promote light-demanding tree species, non-native species and non-local provenances.},

For perhaps 20—30 years, associated with concerns over apparently increasing biological and ecological problems (floods, avalanches, forest die-back, and other calamities) there has been an increasing debate in forestry centered on efforts to bring forest and woodland management back to more ‘natural’ approaches. Conservation and other management in parallel to these arguments are flawed unless based on sound conceptual foundations, and to this end basic principles and concepts have been developed. ‘Naturalness’ is one such concept. However, whilst this is an important term in helping to understand the key processes at work it has proved difficult to integrate with ideas of ‘close-to-nature silviculture’. This paper explores the issues and proposes more effective integration of approaches. Possible ways in which the concept can aid conservation management of woods and forests are suggested.},

Applying resilience theory requires careful articulation of the ecosystem state under consideration, the disturbances and stresses that affect the persistence of possible alternative states, and the spatial and temporal scales of management relevance.

Multi-aged forest management systems represent a promising approach for increasing resistance and resilience, thereby limiting major disruptions to timber production and other ecosystem services. Multi-aged stands inherently have greater resistance and resilience to disturbances because of the presence of several age classes and more potential pathways for post-disturbance management and recovery. The preponderance of research also indicates few differences in productivity between multi-aged and even-aged management strategies. These factors combined suggest that increased adoption of multi-aged management systems will lead to a reduction in long-term risks. We advocate a disturbance integration management strategy that encourages managers to emulate disturbance effects with management, anticipate disturbances in planning, integrate the management of residual stand structures into salvage operations and build variable treatment intervals or cutting cycles into management regimes.},

There is peril in making excessive use of buzzwords as stand-ins for the complex goals that are the real target of forest management. In this paper, I explore the consequences of buzzword mutation, which leads to paradigm creep—the use of buzzwords far beyond their original sphere of application. Such inappropriate use threatens to dilute the meaning of the original metaphor and makes talking clearly about the legitimate targets of forest management more difficult. I use “sustainable development” as an exemplar of a buzzword that has mutated into uselessness.

This paper attempts to evaluate (1) if and how emulation of natural disturbances (END) is being used as a conceptual bases for implementing EM, and more particularly, what strategies are used to define the natural forest of reference, and (2) what temporal and spatial scale strategies are being considered for seven important retention elements (downed woody debris, snags, green trees, corridors, riparian buffers, large patches and old forest)? To conduct this evaluation, five guides from four geographically well-distributed regions in North America are compared. Although END is the central conceptual foundation underlying four of the five guides, a natural forest of reference is not always clearly identified and none of the guides consider future impacts due to global change. The major weakness common to all five guides is the lack of consideration of long-term forest dynamics, particularly the lack of clear strategies for retention elements at a temporal scale longer than a single rotation. Generally, the spatial scales chosen for retention elements are not well-justified ecologically and targets for each retention element are not identified at different spatial scales. We stress that strong efforts have been made to develop forest management that incorporates some elements of natural variability and which considers societal needs, but further improvements are required. We conclude by presenting some suggestions to improve the approach. For example, creating more realistic guidelines in integrating current and future forest dynamics with pre-settlement information and planning rotation lengths that are inspired by the dominant natural disturbance.},

In the past there have been different interpretations. Leibundgut adopts a liberal interpretation, which he relates to primeval forests, whereby he accepts the use of all forms of regeneration, including regeneration on large areas. On the other hand, Möller gives a more strict interpretation based on successional processes.Nowadays the concept needs to be extended to include the importance of favouring diversity of forest biotopes and the potential for using natural processes for economic reasons. It is necessary to utilize a great diversity of silvicultural techniques, following Leibundgut's principle of 'free choice of fellings' (Leibundgut, 1949).},

	abstract = {Introduced forest pests add complexity to forest ecosystem management and can result in great economic losses. Introduction, establishment, and spread of exotic forest pests have been increasing at an alarming rate during the past 200 years. Because these pests have not coevolved with their hosts, they have great potential to cause widespread dieback and mortality. Silviculture is an important part of an integrated pest management program and can be a valuable tool in the prevention, mitigation, and restoration of forest ecosystems threatened by introduced pests. The current role of silviculture in managing introduced forest pests is evolving from one primarily focused upon genetics and tree breeding to a broader scope involving varying scales and strategies and a broad understanding of both host and pest ecology. Invasions typically occur as a progression through three phases: arrival, establishment, and spread. The appropriate silviculture option varies with the phase and the management objective. Eradication of an introduced pest is virtually impossible after the establishment phase. Silviculture during early phases may focus on more intensive or localized operations that attempt to eradicate or substantially limit the range of the pest. During the spread phase, silviculture is focused on preventing further spread by altering stand structures and tree species composition and improving tree vigor. In any phase, the silvicultural operations may be similar, but their timing and juxtaposition on the landscape may differ because of current status of the invasion. These strategies may include the maintenance and restoration of stand structures, enhancement of tree vigor, regeneration of healthy and resistant species, and timber extraction. These silvicultural treatments are similar in both their objective and the operations they require to address native pest problems. For either introduced or native pests, there is a need for development of new, creative silvicultural strategies that develop individualized stand prescriptions within the context of broad-scale management within an integrated pest management program.},

	abstract = {Silviculture is increasingly being applied in ways that go beyond traditional timber management objectives. Across the National Forest System, on other public lands, and increasingly on private lands as well, foresters are working with professional colleagues and landowners to develop innovative silvicultural prescriptions designed to meet diverse resource management objectives. Some of those innovations involve treatments, timing, or intensity that are not supported by published or ongoing research studies. This can lead to problems over time, especially if the treatments fail to achieve their intended goal. To maintain trust and credibility with other resource professionals, as well as with the landowners they serve, silviculturists must act according to a simple philosophy--say what you’ll do, do what you said, and watch what you did. A set of ten quantifiable metrics and subjective tools is suggested as a guide to implementing that simple philosophy. Taken collectively, this set of tools and metrics comprise a subjective decision support framework for silviculturists, especially as practices are proposed that go beyond scientific support in the literature. The degree to which these elements should be quantified depends upon the complications that will arise from failure to detect whether a prescription has been properly prescribed and implemented.},

	abstract = {Across forest ecosystems worldwide, alternative silvicultural practices such as partial or “structural retention” harvesting are gaining increasing use as means to balance economic and ecological management goals. Recent studies have documented highly elevated rates of residual-tree mortality and growth, both of which are likely to inﬂuence post-harvest stand development. Explicit consideration of residual-tree responses to partial harvest is therefore required to make accurate growth and yield predictions. In this paper we incorporate empirically based, spatially explicit tree growth and mortality predictors into a forest simulation model in order to quantify stand dynamics following a range of simulated partial harvests. We consider lowland black spruce boreal forests and use a common strip-cutting technique, Harvest with Advance Regeneration Protection, as a reference against which to compare alternative scenarios. Predicted stand development proceeded most rapidly in scenarios with reduced skidding impacts and relatively high levels of retention, since these treatments were associated with lower residual-tree mortality rates and larger growing stocks respectively. Stand development was also inﬂuenced on a proportional basis by residual-tree growth rates, which increased with declining neighbourhood competition. Across a range of harvest scenarios with equivalent retention levels (20\%), differences in residual-tree responses among treatments led to a 35-year range in projected basal area return intervals (70–105 years). Our results demonstrate that short-term responses of residual trees affect stand development rates over long ({\textgreater}100-year) time scales, and show that post-harvest stand recovery rates are inﬂuenced not only by the retention level but also by the speciﬁc parameters of partial harvest prescriptions, including the layout of skid trails and the spatial arrangement of residual trees. Results from this study provide essential information for evaluating partial harvests in the black spruce boreal forest and supply modelling tools for assessing alternative silvicultural treatments in other forest ecosystems.},

We use data from plots censused by the U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis program during the years 2000–2011 to quantify relationships between two key aspects of climate—mean annual temperature and growing season water deﬁcit—and rates of sapling and canopy tree survival for the 50 most common tree species in the eastern United States. Our analyses include consideration of the effects of tree size, competition, and nitrogen deposition to avoid confounding effects and to provide context for the importance of variation in climate relative to other factors. Tree size and competitive effects, including the effect of tree size on sensitivity to competition, had the greatest impact on observed variation in survival for all of the species. Survival varied as a function of nitrogen deposition in 20 of the 50 species, and responses were stronger in saplings than in canopy trees. Despite clear sorting of the presence of the tree species along regional gradients of temperature and water deﬁcit, there was only modest evidence that either sapling or canopy tree mortality varied systematically along those gradients. For 24 of the 50 species, the most parsimonious models did not include either temperature or water deﬁcit variables. The exceptions to this were for several species of colder climates in which survival declined signiﬁcantly in warmer climates. In 40 of the 50 species, there was no signiﬁcant variation in survival as a function of either average growing season water deﬁcit or the most extreme individual growing season water deﬁcit during the 20 yr preceding the end of the census interval. The frequency of all but the most xeric of our study species declines at some point along a water deﬁcit gradient. But it is seedling survival (reported in earlier work), rather than survival of saplings and canopy trees, that varies systematically along water deﬁcit gradients.},

The equations address two problems that often arise in crown allometry. First, relationships between the main stem and the crown are likely to change with intertree competition. Therefore, explicit measures of density were used along with main stem measurements as explanatory variables. Second, the physiological relationship between CL and CRAD is often overlooked when modeling crowns. This relationship is incorporated through the use of a simultaneous system of equations. Parameters were estimated using nonlinear three-stage least squares (N3SLS) in which first-stage equation estimates of CRAD are used to estimate CL and vice versa in the second and third stages of N3SLS. The equations were fitted and validated for four species: lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Louden var. latifolia Engelm. ex S. Watson), hybrid spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm. × P. glauca (Moench) Voss), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. glauca (Beissn.)

We hypothesized that growth would increase with decreasing competition and increasing light availability, but that proximity to skid trails would negatively affect growth. A total of 300 sugar maples were sampled \$10 years after selection harvesting in 18 stands in Te´ miscamingue (Que´ bec, Canada). Detailed tree and skid trail maps were obtained in one 0.4 ha plot per stand. Square-root transformed radial growth data were ﬁtted to a linear mixed model that included tree diameter, crown position, a neighbourhood competition index, light availability (estimated using the SORTIE light model), and distance to the nearest skid trail as explanatory variables. We considered various distance-dependent or -independent indices based on neighbourhood radii ranging from 6 to 12 m. The competition index that provided the best ﬁt to the data was a distance-dependent index computed in a 6 m search radius, but a distance-independent version of the competition index provided an almost equivalent ﬁt to data. Models corresponding to all combinations of main effects were ﬁt to data using maximum likelihood, and weighted averages of parameter estimates were obtained using multimodel inference. All predictors had an inﬂuence on growth, with the exception of light. Radial growth decreased with increasing tree diameter, level of competition and proximity to skid trails, and varied among crown positions with trees in suppressed and intermediate positions having lower growth rates than codominants and dominants. Our results indicate that in selection managed stands, the radial growth of sugar maple trees depends on competition from close ( 6 m) conspeciﬁc neighbours, and is still affected by proximity to skid trails \$10 years after harvesting. Such results underscore the importance of minimizing the extent of skid trail networks by careful pre-harvest planning of trail layout. We also conclude that the impact of heterogeneity among individual-tree neighbourhoods, such as those resulting from alternative spatial patterns of harvest, can usefully be integrated into models of post-harvest tree growth.},

	abstract = {Robust predictions of competitive interactions among canopy trees and variation in tree growth along environmental gradients represent key challenges for the management of mixed-species, uneven-aged forests. We analyzed the effects of competition on tree growth along environmental gradients for eight of the most common tree species in southern New England and southeastern New York using forest inventory and analysis (FIA) data, information theoretic decision criteria, and multi-model inference to evaluate models. The suite of models estimated growth of individual trees as a species-speciﬁc function of average potential diameter growth, tree diameter at breast height, local environmental conditions, and crowding by neighboring trees. We used ordination based on the relative basal area of species to generate a measure of site conditions in each plot. Two ordination axes were consistent with variation in species abundance along moisture and fertility gradients. Estimated potential growth varied along at least one of these axes for six of the eight species; peak relative abundance of less shade-tolerant species was in all cases displaced away from sites where they showed maximum potential growth. Our crowding functions estimate the strength of competitive effects of neighbors; only one species showed support for the hypothesis that all species of competitors have equivalent effects on growth. The relative weight of evidence (Akaike weights) for the best models varied from a low of 0.207 for Fraxinus americana to 0.747 for Quercus rubra. In such cases, model averaging provides a more robust platform for prediction than that based solely on the best model. We show that predictions based on the selected best models dramatically overestimated differences between species relative to predictions based on the averaged set of models.},

With the advent of mobile terrestrial LiDAR, this ability has been expanded to include the rapid collection of three-dimensional models of large urban scenes. For all its usefulness, it does have drawbacks. One of the major problems faced by the LiDAR industry today is the automatic removal of outlying data points from LiDAR point clouds. This paper discusses the development and combined implementation of two methods of performing outlier detection in georeferenced point clouds. These methods made use of the raw data available from most time-of-flight mobile terrestrial LiDAR scanners in both the temporal and spatial domains. The first method involved a moving fixed interval smoother derived from the well-known position velocity acceleration Kalman Filter. The second method fitted a quadratic curved surface to sections of LiDAR data. The combined use of these routines is discussed through examples with real LiDAR data.},

Portable LiDAR height profiles and derived metrics and indices (e.g., canopy cover, canopy height) were compared among plots with different fire frequency and fire season treatments within secondary forest and old growth plots. The treatments consisted of transitional season fire with four different return intervals: 1-yr, 2-yr, 3-yr fire return intervals, and fire suppressed plots. The remaining secondary plots were treated using a 2-yr late dormant season fire cycle. The old growth plots were treated using a 2-yr growing season fire cycle. Airborne and portable LiDAR derived canopy cover were consistent throughout the plots, with significantly higher canopy cover values found in 3-yr and fire suppressed plots. Portable LiDAR height profile and metrics presented a higher sensitivity in capturing subcanopy elements than the airborne system, particularly in dense canopy plots. The 3-dimensional structures of the secondary plots with varying fire return intervals were dramatically different to old-growth plots, where a symmetrical distribution with clear recruitment was visible.

	abstract = {Aim This study uses the combination of presettlement tree surveys and spatial analysis to produce an empirical reconstruction of tree species abundance and vegetation units at different scales in the original landscape. Location The New England study area extends across eight physiographic sections, from the Appalachian Mountains to the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The data are drawn from 389 original towns in what are now seven states in the north-eastern United States. These towns have early land division records which document the witness trees growing in the town before European settlement (c. seventeenth to eighteenth century ad). Methods Records of witness trees from presettlement surveys were collated from towns throughout the study area (1.3 × 105 km2). Tree abundance was averaged over town-wide samples of multiple forest types, integrating proportions of taxa at a local scale (102 km2). These data were summarized into genus groups over the sample towns, which were then mapped [geographical information system (GIS)], classified (Cluster Analysis) and ordinated [detrended correspondence analysis (DCA)]. Modern climatic and topographic variables were also derived from GIS analyses for each town and all town attributes were quantitatively compared. Distributions of both individual species and vegetation units were analysed and displayed for spatial analysis of vegetation structure. Results The tally of 153,932 individual tree citations show a dominant latitudinal trend in the vegetation. Spatial patterns are concisely displayed as pie charts of genus composition arrayed on sampled towns. Detailed interpolated frequency surfaces show spatial patterns of range and abundance of the dominant taxa. Oak, spruce, hickory and chestnut reach distinctive range limits within the study area. Eight vegetation clusters are distinguished. The northern vegetation is a continuous geographical sequence typified by beech while the southern vegetation is an amorphous group typified by oak. Main conclusions The wealth of information recorded in the New England town presettlement surveys is an ideal data base to elucidate the natural patterns of vegetation over an extensive spatial area. The timing, town-wide scale, expansive coverage, quantitative enumeration and unbiased estimates are critical advantages of proprietor lotting surveys in determining original tree distributions. This historical–geographical approach produces a vivid reconstruction of the natural vegetation and species distributions as portrayed on maps. The spatial, vegetational and environmental patterns all demonstrate a distinct ‘tension zone’ separating ‘northern hardwood’ and ‘central hardwood’ towns. The presettlement northern hardwood forests, absolutely dominated by beech, forms a continuum responding to a complex climatic gradient of altitude and latitude. The oak forests to the south are distinguished by non-zonal units, probably affected by fire. Although at the continental scale, the forests seem to be a broad transition, at a finer scale they respond to topography such as the major valleys or the northern mountains. This study resets some preconceptions about the original forest, such as the overestimation of the role of pine, hemlock and chestnut and the underestimation of the distinctiveness of the tension zone. Most importantly, the forests of the past and their empirical description provide a basis for many ecological, educational and management applications today.},

	abstract = {There is growing interest in using spatially explicit, individual-based forest simulation models to explore the ecological and silvicultural consequences of various harvesting regimes. However, simulating the dynamics of managed forests requires harvesting algorithms capable of accurately mimicking the harvest regimes of interest. Under selection silviculture, trees are harvested individually or in small groups, with the aim of retaining trees across a full range of size classes. An algorithm that reproduces selection harvesting must therefore be able to recreate both the spatial and the structural patterns of harvest. Here we introduce a selection harvest algorithm that simulates harvests as a contagious spatial process in which the cutting of one tree affects the probability that neighboring trees are also cut. Three simple and intuitive parameters are required to implement this process: (1) the probability of cutting a “target” tree (Pt) (often a function of tree size), (2) the probability of cutting its nearest neighbor (Pn), and (3) the total number of target trees to cut (Nt). Speciﬁcation of these parameters allows representation of both the spatial and the structural patterns of harvest expected under selection silviculture.},

Further, I conjecture that management aimed at quality improvement can achieve measurable results in yields and dollars at least as fast as management aimed simply at tons. In any event, land managers must be held accountable for quality renewal and not allowed to use improved technology as an excuse for high-grading. Managers should be setting “stretch goals” for quality in the annual cut as well as in the growing inventory.},

	abstract = {Our objective was to describe the trends of Vermont stumpage prices for major sawtimber species and products over the approximately last quarter century and propose a likely explanation of changes that we observed. Annual percentage rates of change (APR) were estimated for 10 forest products in Vermont from the third quarter of 1981 (1981Q3) to the ﬁrst quarter of 2007 (2007Q1) when the price series was discontinued. In addition, we tested for changes in the percentage rate within the period. We found differences in the trend of APR between hardwood sawtimber and softwood sawtimber. With one exception, price trends differed signiﬁcantly between 1981Q3 to 1992Q2 and 1992Q3 to 2007Q1 for inﬂation-adjusted (real) hardwood sawtimber prices. There were no differences in price trends for any of the softwood sawtimber species between the two periods. Real price trends for pulpwood and ﬁrewood were similar to those for hardwood sawtimber. We also examined stumpage price trends for selected species in adjacent New Hampshire from 1985Q1 to 2011Q1. Stumpage price trends for like species and proximate time periods in Vermont and New Hampshire were similar, but no statistical tests were done. The direction of trend (positive or negative) was the same for sugar maple, red oak, yellow birch, and white pine, and the magnitude of APR was similar for sugar maple, yellow birch, and white pine.},

Replicated treatments include the selection system, uniform sheltcrwood, unregulated harvesting, and diameter-limit cutting. The new cohort established under three-stage shelterwood was subsequently left untreated or precommercially thinned. Betweentreatment differences in net volume growth were not significant (a = 0.10), though gross volume growth differed significantly for managed vs. unmanaged, selection vs. shelterwood, and shelterwood vs. diameter-limit treatments. A three-stage shelterwood method with precommercial thinning 10 years following final overstory removal resulted in good control of hardwoods and hemlock and a dramatic increase in spruce and fir. The selection system on a 5-year cutclng cycle resulted In mcreased hemlock, spruce, and fir, with a decrease in hardwood species. If the pnmary goal wcrc production, even-aged management would most likely be preferred. We recommend a two-stage shelterwood method as applied in this experiment with some modification to improve species composition and stand quality. Stand quality (proportion of stand volume in cull trees) and species composition was influenced by treatment.},

Process-based models, which are based on a theoretical understanding of relevant ecological processes, provide a useful framework to incorporate specific responses to altered environmental conditions. As a result, these models can offer significant advantages in predicting the effects of global change as compared to purely statistical or rule-based models based on previously collected data. Process-based models also offer more explicitly stated assumptions and easier interpretation than detailed simulation models. We provide guidelines for identifying the appropriate type of model and level of complexity for management decisions. Finally we outline some of those factors that make modeling for local and regional management under global change a particular challenge: changes to relevant scales and processes, additional sources of uncertainty, legacy effects, threshold dynamics, and socio-economic impacts.},

	abstract = {Background: Growth and yield models are important tools for forest planning. Due to its geographic location, topology, and history of management, the forests of the Adirondacks Region of New York are unique and complex. However, only a relatively limited number of growth and yield models have been developed and/or can be reasonably extended to this region currently.
Methods: In this analysis, 571 long–term continuous forest inventory plots with a total of 10 – 52 years of measurement data from four experimental forests maintained by the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry and one nonindustrial private forest were used to develop an individual tree growth model for the primary hardwood and softwood species in the region. Species–specific annualized static and dynamic equations were developed using the available data and the system was evaluated for long–term behavior.
Results: Equivalence tests indicated that the Northeast Variant of the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS–NE) was biased in its estimation of tree total and bole height, diameter and height increment, and mortality for most species examined. In contrast, the developed static and annualized dynamic, species–specific equations performed quite well given the underlying variability in the data. Long–term model projections were consistent with the data and suggest a relatively robust system for prediction.
Conclusions: Overall, the developed growth model showed reasonable behavior and is a significant improvement over existing models for the region. The model also highlighted the complexities of forest dynamics in the region and should help improve forest planning efforts there.},

	abstract = {Most studies comparing the predictive performance of distance-independent and -dependent competition metrics have been conducted in even-aged, single species stands. In addition, past studies have generally not considered more sophisticated distance-dependent competition metrics such as open sky-view or light interception indices. Using data from fully stem mapped inventory plots (n = 260) established in structurally complex, mixed-species experimental forests (n = 5) in the Northeastern US, we evaluated prediction performance of one- and two-sided distance-dependent as well as more conventional distance-independent competition metrics in both annualized diameter increment (n = 1735) and probability of survival models (n = 1953) developed across 26 contrasting softwood and hardwood species. Prediction accuracy of non-spatial and spatial models was further assessed by classifying observations by species shade-tolerance, relative tree height, time since harvest, and tree clumping. Our analyses revealed no general superiority of distance-dependent competition metrics over their distanceindependent counterparts for either diameter increment or survival, which was particularly true for the latter variable. Distance-dependent metrics tended to outperform distance-independent ones for observations from shade-tolerant species, trees of lower crown classes, and immediately after harvest. However, results on the comparative analysis of the predictive power of the different types of competition metrics under varying stand conditions and situations were often inconsistent and not always conclusive. In addition, model complexity, i.e. number of non-spatial explanatory variables in the base model, strongly affected the performance of distancedependent competition metrics. Our findings thus appear to support the critical assumption that distance-independent competition metrics are sufficient for most operational growth and yield applications, even in managed, naturally-regenerated and species rich forests.},

	abstract = {The Basal-Area-in-Larger Trees (BAL) is a measure of competition which is often used in individual-tree growth modelling. However, depending on the inventory design used for sampling the parameterization data, this competition variable is characterized by a specific resolution which has an effect on the model coefficients. If such an individual-tree growth model is used for growth projections, differing BAL-resolution might cause biased predictions of stand development. In this analysis, we used the individual-tree growth simulator PROGNAUS to display the source of this problem, and to test the simple method of tree record splitting to reduce this bias. Initial conditions for these growth simulations were obtained from sample plots of different size which were located in a larger stand. A growth period of 150 years was simulated for all sample plots and for the full stand applying the tree record splitting method alternatively. The results show that the change in the BAL-resolution, and therefore, the bias in the predicted stand development depends on plot size and on the length of the simulation period. Furthermore, the final diameter-distributions of the sample plots are significantly different from the diameter-distribution of the full stand showing greater deviations on small plots. However, if the sample tree splitting method is applied, the BAL-resolution can be held more or less constant during the course of growth projection and the bias in the predicted stand development is reduced. Moreover, the sample tree splitting method ensures that the final diameter-distributions at the end of the growth period closely match the diameter-distribution of the full stand. Thus, the proposed tree record splitting method is concerned with the problem of making a model more realistic from an ecological point of view, representing exactly the front line of today’s research in ecological modelling.},

	abstract = {Assessing forest productivity is important for developing effective management regimes and predicting future growth. Despite some important limitations, the most common means for quantifying forest stand-level potential productivity is site index (SI). Another measure of productivity is gross primary production (GPP). In this paper, SI is compared with GPP estimates obtained from 3-PG and NASA’s MODIS satellite. Models were constructed that predict SI and both measures of GPP from climate variables. Results indicated that a nonparametric model with two climate-related predictor variables explained over 68\% and 76\% of the variation in SI and GPP, respectively. The relationship between GPP and SI was limited (R2 of 36\%–56\%), while the relationship between GPP and climate (R2 of 76\%–91\%) was stronger than the one between SI and climate (R2 of 68\%–78\%). The developed SI model was used to predict SI under varying expected climate change scenarios. The predominant trend was an increase of 0–5 m in SI, with some sites experiencing reductions of up to 10 m. The developed model can predict SI across a broad geographic scale and into the future, which statistical growth models can use to represent the expected effects of climate change more effectively.},

	abstract = {Accurate and reliable prediction of clinical progression over time has the potential to improve the outcomes of chronic disease. The classical approach to analyzing longitudinal data is to use (generalized) linear mixed-effect models (GLMM). However, linear parametric models are predicated on assumptions, which are often difficult to verify. In contrast, data-driven machine learning methods can be applied to derive insight from the raw data without a priori assumptions. However, the underlying theory of most machine learning algorithms assume that the data is independent and identically distributed, making them inefficient for longitudinal supervised learning. In this study, we formulate an analytic framework, which integrates the random-effects structure of GLMM into non-linear machine learning models capable of exploiting temporal heterogeneous effects, sparse and varying-length patient characteristics inherent in longitudinal data. We applied the derived mixed-effect machine learning (MEml) framework to predict longitudinal change in glycemic control measured by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) among well controlled adults with type 2 diabetes. Results show that MEml is competitive with traditional GLMM, but substantially outperformed standard machine learning models that do not account for random-effects. Specifically, the accuracy of MEml in predicting glycemic change at the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th clinical visits in advanced was 1.04, 1.08, 1.11, and 1.14 times that of the gradient boosted model respectively, with similar results for the other methods. To further demonstrate the general applicability of MEml, a series of experiments were performed using real publicly available and synthetic data sets for accuracy and robustness. These experiments reinforced the superiority of MEml over the other methods. Overall, results from this study highlight the importance of modeling random-effects in machine learning approaches based on longitudinal data. Our MEml method is highly resistant to correlated data, readily accounts for random-effects, and predicts change of a longitudinal clinical outcome in real-world clinical settings with high accuracy.},

	abstract = {A new taper model was developed based on the switching taper model of Valentine and Gregoire; the most substantial changes were reformulation to incorporate estimated join points and modification of a switching function. Random-effects parameters were included that account for within-tree correlations and allow for customized calibration to each individual tree. The new model was applied to 19 species groups from data collected on 2,448 trees across the northeastern United States. A comparison of fit statistics showed considerable improvement for the new model. The largest absolute residuals occurred near the tree base, whereas the residuals standardized in relation to tree diameter were generally constant along the length of the stem. There was substantial variability in the rate of taper at the base of the tree, particularly for trees with relatively large dbh. Similar trends were found in independent validation data. The use of random effects allows uncertainty in computed tree volumes to compare favorably with another regional taper equation that uses upper-stem diameter information for local calibration. However, comparisons with results for a locally developed model showed that the local model provided more precise estimates of volume. FOR. SCI. 56(6):515–528.},

These approaches are useful when Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data are available. LiDAR height data can be employed to predict tree d.b.h., and consequently individual tree volumes and volume/ ha can be obtained for the tract. In this paper, we will examine alternative methods of predicting d.b.h. from total height and crown length (model 2a), or from total height, crown length, and number of trees per acre (model 2b), based on the uniform stress theory. The uniform stress theory hypothesizes that stems behave like tapered cantilever beams to equalize bending stress across their length. The four models were evaluated based on the mean difference between observed and predicted diameters, mean absolute difference, and fit index. Results revealed that the two models based on the uniform stress theory (models 2a and 2b) were more appropriate for predicting d.b.h., which is needed to compute tract volume using LiDAR data.},

Unlike most previous work on modeling tree form, this effort necessarily includes a wide array of tree species. For some species, branching patterns can produce undesirable tree form that reduces the merchantable portion of the stem and merchantable heights to a fixed top diameter (e.g., 4 inches) are often unrealized. Thus, height estimates from a taper model tend to overestimate the actual merchantable length of the stem. This phenomenon is exacerbated as tree size increases. The extent of this problem is illustrated by comparing taper-derived merchantable height estimates to observed merchantable height measurements on trees from NE-FIA sample plots. Models were developed using individual tree attributes to adjust the taper-based estimates to account for reductions in merchantable height due to tree form.},

Classical partial dependence plots (PDPs) help visualize the average partial relationship between the predicted response and one or more features. In the presence of substantial interaction eﬀects, the partial response relationship can be heterogeneous. Thus, an average curve, such as the PDP, can obfuscate the complexity of the modeled relationship. Accordingly, ICE plots reﬁne the partial dependence plot by graphing the functional relationship between the predicted response and the feature for individual observations. Speciﬁcally, ICE plots highlight the variation in the ﬁtted values across the range of a covariate, suggesting where and to what extent heterogeneities might exist. In addition to providing a plotting suite for exploratory analysis, we include a visual test for additive structure in the data generating model. Through simulated examples and real data sets, we demonstrate how ICE plots can shed light on estimated models in ways PDPs cannot. Procedures outlined are available in the R package ICEbox.},

Measurement periods of varying length complicate efforts to fit growth models because observed growth rates must be interpolated to a common length growth period or those growth periods longer or shorter than the desired model time step must be discarded. A variation of the iterative technique suggested by Cao [Cao, Q.V., 2000. Prediction of annual diameter growth and survival for individual trees from periodic measurements. Forest Sci. 46, 127-1311 was applied to estimate annualized diameter and height growth equations for pure plantations of Douglas-fir, western hemlock, and red alder. Using this technique, fits were significantly improved for all three species by embedding a multi-level nonlinear mixed-effects framework (likelihood ratio test: p {\textless} 0.0001). The final models were consistent with expected biologic\$ behavior of diameter and height growth over tree, stand, and site variables. The random effects showed some correlation with key physiographic variables such as slope and aspect for Douglas-fir and red alder, but these relationships were not observed for western hemlock. Further, the random effects were more correlated with physiographicvariables than actual climate or soils information. Longterm simulations(12-16 years) on an independentdataset using these annualizedequations showedthat the multi-levelmixed effects models were more accurate and precise than those fitted without random effectsas mean squareerror (MSE) was reduced by 13 and 21\%for diameter and height growth prediction, respectively. The level of prediction e m r was also smaller than an existing similar growth model with a longer time step (ORGANON v8) as the annualized equationsreduced MSE by 17 and 38\%for diameterand height growthprediction, respectively. These models will prove to be quite useful for understanding the interaction of weather and silviculturein the Pacific Northwest and refining the precision of future growth model projections.},

This study aimed to determine suitable methods to obtain parameter estimates for such a system from periodic measurements. Given a system consisting of a tree survival model and a tree diameter growth model, this paper presents an iterative method for estimating system parameters. The method involves sequentially updating of the parameters of both models within the growth period. Data from 111 plots from the Southwide Seed Source Study of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) were then used to evaluate this iterative approach against the averaging method that assumes a constant tree survival probability and diameter growth rate during the remeasurement interval. Results indicated that the iterative method out-performed the averaging method in predicting future individual tree survival, diameter growth, and stand basal area. The iterative method was superior because it accounted for the variable rate of diameter growth and tree survival probability as functions of ever-changing stand and tree attributes. FOR.

	abstract = {This paper discusses the dynamic deﬁnition of irregularity; it looks at conditions of sustainability and considers under which conditions irregularity could be promoted efﬁciently. Irregularity is not usually innate in natural forest ecosystems, the exception being in certain developmental stages of old or over-mature stands. Because of these natural tendencies, it is necessary to differentiate between temporary stand structures and sustainable irregular systems. Therefore, any assessment of irregularity needs to take the rules of demographic regulation into account. Different kinds of irregularity are discussed, as is the reference scale for implementation. This makes it possible to distinguish between genuine irregularity within the crown layer, full (vertical) irregularity on stand level (plenter system) and horizontal irregularity (for greater reference scales), by creating irregular patches (as under the irregular shelterwood system). The paper presents the differences between broadleaved species and conifers in a full irregular plenter system with a developed vertical structure. These differences are due to the degree to which tree species can support shade, without losing the ability to recover qualitative capacity and, for older stages, to use crown space efﬁciently. Other factors are also important: the reaction of tree species to openings, the production of epicormic branches, topology and crown expansion. Therefore, broadleaved plenter forests need much lower equilibrium standing volumes than classical conifer plenter forests and there are also losses in volume increment and stem quality. The silvicultural results produced by the different models for differentiating stands and promoting irregularity are also discussed. It is assumed that for broadleaved species, the compromise between the necessary educative steps (shaping of the stem form within tree populations) and closure control function are better in small populations (openings) than in stands with a single tree structure. Because the ultimate aim is to create not one, but several, co-existing forms of heterogeneity, in the sense of creating varied habitats, modern silviculture should make use of all silvicultural tools. This is a signiﬁcant challenge for silvicultural expertise.},

	abstract = {Many scientists and foresters have begun to embrace an ecological, natural disturbance paradigm for management, but lack speciﬁc guidance on how to design systems in ways that are in harmony with natural patterns. To provide such guidance, we conducted a comprehensive literature survey of northeastern disturbances, emphasizing papers that studied late-successional, undisturbed, or presettlement forests. Evidence demonstrates convincingly that such forests were dominated by relatively frequent, partial disturbances that produced a ﬁnely patterned, diverse mosaic dominated by late-successional species and structures. In contrast, large-scale, catastrophic stand-replacing disturbances were rare, returning at intervals of at least one order of magnitude longer than gap-producing events. Graphing the contiguous areas disturbed against their corresponding return intervals shows that these important disturbance parameters are positively related; area disturbed increases exponentially as the return interval lengthens. This graph provides a convenient metric, termed the natural disturbance comparability index, against which to evaluate both single and multi-cohort silvicultural systems based on their rotations or cutting-cycles and stand or gap sizes. We review implications of these ﬁndings for silvicultural practice in the region, and offer recommendations for emulating natural disturbance regimes. \# 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Disturbance-based silvicultural systems generally seek to promote complex stand structures that are consistent with temporal and spatial patterns of natural disturbance while allowing for the sustainable harvest of timber. Gap-based harvesting systems are commonly used within this framework because they can be designed to approximate the frequencies and spatial patterns of a wide array of disturbance regimes. Patterns in stand-level growth, sapling recruitment and regeneration response were examined for one such gap-based system, the Acadian Forest Ecosystem Research Program (AFERP) in central Maine, that was designed to emulate the annual 1\% disturbance frequency typical of the northeastern United States and Canada. A decade after treatment, stand-level differences in basal area growth and density between two gap-based treatments and an unharvested control were not statistically signiﬁcant, largely due to low replication, but within-stand growth and regeneration responses differed strongly by spatial position relative to harvest gaps. Regeneration of shade-tolerant and intolerant species increased regardless of gap size, likely a response to increasing light availability from canopy openings due to harvesting and mortality. Further, there was evidence of gap size effects on sapling recruitment as large gaps ({\textgreater}1000 m2) favored the growth and survival of mid-successional species such as red maple and white pine, while small gaps ({\textless}1000 m2) favored late-succession species such as eastern hemlock and spruce. Overstory growth rates also differed by both species and position relative to harvest gaps with most species growing best in gaps and better along gap edges than in adjacent forest. Notably, overstory growth rates for white pine were not inﬂuenced by spatial position. These results suggest harvest gaps may have signiﬁcant growth and regeneration impacts in adjacent, yet unharvested areas, which could lead to profound differences in forest development over the rotation. Obviously, longer-term studies of gap-based systems are needed to more clearly elucidate these responses.},

	abstract = {Forest management objectives continue to evolve as the desires and needs of society change. The practice of silviculture has risen to the challenge by supplying silvicultural methods and systems to produce desired stand and forest structures and compositions to meet these changing objectives. For the most part, the practice of silviculture offers a robust set of procedures well suited for the timely and efﬁcient production of timber crops, but often leaving simpliﬁed forests that do not necessarily reﬂect historical conditions, do neither provide a full range of wildlife habitats, nor provide a sense of place for many different forest users. We propose a silvicultural system that we call ‘‘free selection’’. This multi-entry, uneven-aged system is intended for use in forests in which the remaining structure and composition is paramount. It is well suited for restoring the old-growth character of forests as well as reducing the risk of wildﬁre within the urban interface. Rather than using precise stand structural guidelines to deﬁne the stand treatments, we suggest that a well articulated ‘‘vision’’ of the immediate and desired future conditions is used to guide the planning and control the marking. This vision accounts for the interaction of all components of a forest from below ground to the high forest canopy. It relies on an integrated ecological view of how forests function. We have applied free selection guided by such a vision in both the moist (Thuja plicata Donn. ex D. Don, Abies grandis (Dougl. ex D. Don) Lindl., Tsuga heterophylla [Raf.] Sarg.) forests of northern Idaho to reduce the risk of wildﬁre damaging historical buildings and in the dry (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) forests of southern Idaho to restore their old-growth character. \# 2005 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Continuous cover forestry (CCF) is not a new idea in forest management but there has been renewed interest in it for the potential it has to meet the sustainability requirements which are part of the Rio/ Helsinki process and certiﬁcation. Broadly speaking CCF includes those silvicultural systems which involve continuous and uninterrupted maintenance of forest cover and which avoid clearcutting. However, there is considerable confusion with regard to terms and deﬁnitions and even the phrase continuous cover forestry is not universally known. CCF systems are being introduced throughout Europe, where there is emphasis on the direct transformation of existing even-aged plantations to some form of mixed, uneven-aged woodland. There is also the opportunity to establish such woodlands either at re-stocking or when afforesting former agricultural land but so far there has been little discussion of the methods that can be used to do this. One approach would be to use nurse crops to aid establishment of desired species, especially where there are difﬁcult site conditions or the trees naturally require cover for optimal growth. The use of nurse crops is already a familiar part of forest practice and has found various applications in Britain, Scandinavia and other parts of Europe. This paper outlines the historical roots of continuous cover forestry, discusses deﬁnitions and features of the current debate and explores potential silvicultural methods with special attention to the direct establishment of mixed forest stands through afforestation and restocking.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the individual-tree diameter response of mature silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) to reproduction harvests (Femelschlag: an irregular group shelterwood method) on six sites in the Black Forest, Germany. On each site, four different treatments were applied, including a control treatment and short-, medium, and long-term regeneration periods aimed at the complete removal of overstory trees within 20, 35, and 50 years, respectively. These treatments created a wide variety of growing conditions for individual trees. Relationships between relative diameter growth and standlevel and neighborhood interaction indices were evaluated. Growing conditions for individual trees in control conditions were best characterized using Lorimer’s index for a 16 m radius neighborhood. Equations predicting tree growth in control stands underpredicted initial growth of trees after harvesting operations, suggesting a release effect that is not captured by postharvest density. This effect was larger for smaller trees and influenced by removal intensity. Growth response to density reductions was also influenced by previous harvests. Our results suggest that the growth response of mature trees to reproduction harvests may become an important consideration when increased emphasis is placed on managing for longterm regeneration periods.

Strategies might include forms of uniform partial cutting, or patch cutting combined with thinning. The approach depends upon the shade tolerance and regeneration potential of the component species. Also, the limited growth potential of original trees that occupied poor crown positions will force landowners to rely on the dominants and co-dominants as residual growing stock during the conversion of most even-aged stands.

However, the single-tree or small-group selection methods used may produce long-term results that are similar to high-grading in shifting stand composition toward shade tolerant species (many of which have low timber value). A review was made of the extensive research on the use of the selection method in northern New England and central Appalachian forest types, as well as of the limited research in the southern New England transition hardwood-white pine (Pinus strobus)-hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) type. Recent management experience in a Massachusetts public watershed forest was also reviewed. These provide general guidelines for using selection cutting in the region to regenerate species of a wide range in shade tolerance: (a) use patch selection (rather than single-tree or group selection) with a minimum patch size of 0.3 ac, and with understory as well as overstory trees removed in the patches; (b) use area control (proportion of stand to be harvested) rather than a target diameter distribution (q-value or other method) to regulate the stand cutting level. This approach is likely to be effective in meeting regeneration goals and in being logistically feasible, given the intensity of management possible on most of these properties. North. J. Appl.

Potential cone crops could be predicted by estimating the number of developing cone buds, newly flushed cones or mature seed cones. These predictions will be valuable for estimating potential natural regeneration in the forest and will allow forest managers to plan silvicultural operations to encourage natural regeneration if this is desired. The most suitable time of assessment will depend on the species; earlier predictions will be less accurate and more difficult to carry out, while later predictions will give less advance warning of potential seed crops and potential natural regeneration.},

In this study, we quantified the development of natural northern white-cedar seedlings and saplings under various partial cutting regimes, with and without white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virgianus Zimmerman) browsing, in three selected sites in Quebec (Canada) and in Maine (USA). Our data show that northern white-cedar regeneration was present in all studied stands, but that only a few stems were taller than 30 cm on the two sites with high densities of deer. In the absence of heavy browsing, stems reached a height of 30 cm in 11 years, and 130 cm in 28 years. Height growth of northern white-cedar regeneration increased with canopy light transmittance, while ground-level diameter increment increased after partial cutting. This suggests that partial cutting can be used in mixedwood stands to release natural northern white-cedar regeneration, but also that the recruitment of northern white-cedar seedlings to larger size classes constitutes a major challenge in stands subject to heavy deer browsing.},

Excessive bracken frond litter and hayscented fern root mats can also prevent adequate germination and seedling development. In addition, the herbaceous cover may harbor detrimental small herbivores, while large ones often preferentially browse seedlings that grow through this layer. Increased understory light levels after an overstory disturbance, abundant soil moisture, fire, and herbivory promote ferns, whereas excessive and repeated cold or drought deter fern development and propagation. The most promising control methods repress ferns until seedlings cast adequate shade to inhibit further development of the fern layer. When ferns cover more than 30\% of the understory, well-timed applications of either glyphosate or sulfometuron methyl have successfully controlled hayscented, New York, and bracken ferns. Two carefully timed mowings annually for at least 2 years have also provided long-lasting control on level, accessible sites. Deer populations must be reduced where browsing prevents development of desirable plants. North. J. Appl. For. 23(3):166 –175.},

	abstract = {The structure and growth of northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis) was studied in 16 stands on wet sites in Vermont. White cedar and associate species representing the range in diameter were felled for stem analysis. Height growth curves were constructed. Structure of white cedar stands on wet sites in Vermont is often even-aged with a relatively uniform canopy due to restocking of former agricultural land, or two-aged, or multiaged, depending on degree of harvesting and other disturbances. On bog and swamp sites, cedar may reach less than 25 ft in height in 50 years whereas on upland sites wet only a portion of the growing season, they may reach 50 ft or greater in height. On well-drained upland sites, height growth may be greater, but cedar most likely may be displaced by other conifers and hardwoods. Basal area in pure and well-stocked maturing stands may exceed 300 ft2, and volumes can exceed 12,000 ft3/ac. In high-density stands, there is usually little understory. Very small amounts of cedar regeneration were observed in the stands studied. Some of the stands had a distinct browse line, and deer are presumed to have a major impact on cedar regeneration. All cedar stands are recognized as being of great importance as deer wintering areas. On the low-quality swamp and bog sites, minimal and careful harvest of cedar should be done to maintain deer habitat, integrity of the tree canopy, and associated understory vegetation. On sites with less water restrictions than in swamps and bogs, harvesting practices to maintain wildlife habitat and assure regeneration and thinning and pruning to improve growth rate and value of harvested wood should be considered.

This article synthesizes recent and historical northern white-cedar literature, with a focus on ecology, regeneration, cedar-wildlife interactions, and silviculture. Although a number of past studies have produced contradictory ﬁndings, some generalizations of use to the practitioner can be made: northern white-cedar is of small stature, slow growing, decay prone except on cliff sites, and found in both early- and late-successional stands. Northern white-cedar appears to be a highly variable species that can adapt to a wide range of environmental stresses. Because management of this resource has proven difﬁcult, northern white-cedar silvicultural guidelines are needed throughout its range.},

	abstract = {The northern hardwood research program at the Dukes Experimental Forest in Michigan and Argonne Experimental Forest in Wisconsin has been adapting to changing management and social objectives for more than 80 years. In 1926, the first northern hardwood silviculture study was established in old-growth stands at the Dukes Experimental Forest. In response to social demands for more “natural” forestry, the study included then-contemporary practices (e.g., liquidation of oldgrowth forest) and new approaches (e.g., partial cuttings). By 1953, the partial cutting treatments were deemed most sustainable (Eyre and Zillgitt, Partial cuttings in northern hardwoods of the Lake States: twenty-year experimental results. Technical Bulletin LS-1076, 1953), and led to the creation of an uneven-aged stand structural guide that is still widely used today: the famed “Arbogast Guide” (Marking guides for northern hardwoods under the selection system. Station Paper 56, 1957). Charismatic figures such as Raphael Zon, Windy Eyre, William Zillgitt, and Carl Arbogast Jr. were important to establishing this research and its early application in the Lake States region. Since then, research at the Dukes and Argonne Experimental Forests has expanded to evaluate a range of management alternatives for northern hardwood forests, including approaches designed to sustain biodiversity, habitat, and timber production. In addition, the long-term studies provide new opportunities for larger-scale applications and research unforeseen at the studies’ establishment. The lessons learned from the 80 years of research on northern hardwood ecosystems at the Dukes and Argonne Experimental Forests have led to numerous publications and management guides and have impacted thousands of forestry professionals and millions of hectares of land.},

	abstract = {The Langsaeter hypothesis states, “The total production of cubic volume by a stand of given age and composition on a given site is, for all practical purposes, constant and optimum for a wide range of density of stocking. It can be decreased, but not increased, by altering the amount of growing stock to levels outside this range.” We used a multistep approach to test this hypothesis in a 46-year-old red pine plantation growing on a site of moderate quality in northern Minnesota. First, we used stem analysis data to construct tree-level red pine volume equations and compared them to existing equations. We then calculated stand-level volume. Doing this allowed us to evaluate the performance of two stand-level volume prediction equations, a growth and yield spreadsheet package, and a computer simulation model using 10-year pre- and post-thinning measurements. Tree volume prediction equations were similar to existing equations. For 10-year projections, the stand-level volume prediction equations and growth projection models provided volume estimates within 10\% of actual volumes on average. Ten-year post-thinning measurements showed that a geometric, strip thinning to 100 ft2 of basal area resulted in a 40\% volume gain, a crown thinning to 125 ft2 of basal area a 35\% volume gain, and a low thinning to 140 ft2 of basal area a 30\% volume gain, while an unharvested control had a 22\% gain in volume relative to residual stand volumes. Although we found the 10-year volume growth varied less than 1 cord acϪ1 between residual growing stock volumes retained in this study, we do not have strong evidence to support the Langsaeter hypothesis for red pine.

	abstract = {The maximum size–density relationships or self-thinning lines were developed for three mixed-softwood climax forest habitats (hemlock-red spruce, spruce-ﬁr, and cedar-black spruce) in the northeastern USA. The plot data were collected from an extensive data base used in growth studies from 1950 to 1970, and represented a wide range of species compositions, sites, management options, and densities. Plots having late successional species compositions with relative density index higher than 0.7 were selected as the most fully-stocked plots for model development. Reduced major axis regression was used to ﬁt the self-thinning lines to the data. The differences between the three forest habitats were tested using the 95\% conﬁdence intervals of the coefﬁcients of the self-thinning lines. The results indicated that there were no differences between the hemlock-red spruce and spruce-ﬁr habitats for both relationships of the mean tree volume versus number of trees, and the quadratic mean tree diameter versus number of trees. Thus, these two habitats were combined to develop a single self-thinning line. However, the cedar-black spruce forest habitat required a separate self-thinning line. These maximum size–density relationships can be readily used to construct stand density management diagrams. \# 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Although white pine has lost much of its former dominance, it remains a valuable species for biotic diversity, aesthetics, wildlife habitat and forest products. Understanding its silvics and damaging agents provides a sound basis for the silvicultural activities of site selection, regeneration and stand tending. The species can be successfully grown in many locations despite herbivory, competition, white pine weevil and blister rust. Forest managers can minimize damage by applying knowledge of local conditions (climate, soils, physiography and vegetation) to hazard assessment, site selection and preparation, vegetation management, and pruning. With appropriate management and a long-term commitment, many eastern forests can be beneﬁcially reforested to eastern white pine with little impact from blister rust and other damaging agents.},

	abstract = {In its basic deﬁnition, the individual tree target diameter is the hypothetical end diameter to which trees should be grown in order to maximize the expectation value of the forest stand. Most studies on target diameter harvesting have focused on the estimation of simple, static target diameters common to all trees or groups of trees. However, dynamic interaction between trees and differences in growth potential and quality affect the rate of return of individual tree growth, and thereby the target diameter of the tree. Based on a 4.9 ha experimental beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) stand in southern Sweden, we estimated individual tree target diameters by maximizing the expectation value of the stand while taking the spatial position and interaction of the trees into consideration. At moderate levels of required rate of return (2–3\%) the average target diameter was 59–66 cm with a standard deviation of 13–19 cm. Results indicated that the target diameter depends strongly on stem quality, distance to neighboring trees (competition), and the quality of neighboring trees. When analyzing the effect of including neighborhoods of different size in the assessment of target diameters, the marginal change of the total expectation value remained signiﬁcant, even when 10–12 trees had already been included, but converged fast for larger neighborhoods. Expectation values obtained using simpliﬁed management approaches were 10–20\% lower than that of the spatially optimal solution. It is thus evident that the inclusion of the spatial position and quality of individual trees improves proﬁtability of forest management considerably.},

	abstract = {Models are pivotal for assessing future forest dynamics under the impacts of changing climate and management practices, incorporating representations of tree growth, mortality, and regeneration. Quantitative studies on the importance of mortality submodels are scarce. We evaluated 15 dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) regarding their sensitivity to different formulations of tree mortality under different degrees of climate change. The set of models comprised eight DVMs at the stand scale, three at the landscape scale, and four typically applied at the continental to global scale. Some incorporate empirically derived mortality models, and others are based on experimental data, whereas still others are based on theoretical reasoning. Each DVM was run with at least two alternative mortality submodels. Model behavior was evaluated against empirical time series data, and then, the models were subjected to different scenarios of climate change. Most DVMs matched empirical data quite well, irrespective of the mortality submodel that was used. However, mortality submodels that performed in a very similar manner against past data often led to sharply different trajectories of forest dynamics under future climate change. Most DVMs featured high sensitivity to the mortality submodel, with deviations of basal area and stem numbers on the order of 10–40\% per century under current climate and 20–170\% under climate change. The sensitivity of a given DVM to scenarios of climate change, however, was typically lower by a factor of two to three. We conclude that (1) mortality is one of the most uncertain processes when it comes to assessing forest response to climate change, and (2) more data and a better process understanding of tree mortality are needed to improve the robustness of simulated future forest dynamics. Our study highlights that comparing several alternative mortality formulations in DVMs provides valuable insights into the effects of process uncertainties on simulated future forest dynamics.},

	abstract = {Accurately predicting the time of occurrence of an event of interest is a critical problem in longitudinal data analysis. One of the main challenges in this context is the presence of instances whose event outcomes become unobservable after a certain time point or when some instances do not experience any event during the monitoring period. Such a phenomenon is called censoring which can be effectively handled using survival analysis techniques. Traditionally, statistical approaches have been widely developed in the literature to overcome this censoring issue. In addition, many machine learning algorithms are adapted to effectively handle survival data and tackle other challenging problems that arise in real-world data. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured review of the representative statistical methods along with the machine learning techniques used in survival analysis and provide a detailed taxonomy of the existing methods. We also discuss several topics that are closely related to survival analysis and illustrate several successful applications in various real-world application domains. We hope that this paper will provide a more thorough understanding of the recent advances in survival analysis and offer some guidelines on applying these approaches to solve new problems that arise in applications with censored data.},

	abstract = {Learning from imbalanced data is an important and common problem. Decision trees, supplemented with sampling techniques, have proven to be an effective way to address the imbalanced data problem. Despite their effectiveness, however, sampling methods add complexity and the need for parameter selection. To bypass these difﬁculties we propose a new decision tree technique called Hellinger Distance Decision Trees (HDDT) which uses Hellinger distance as the splitting criterion. We analytically and empirically demonstrate the strong skew insensitivity of Hellinger distance and its advantages over popular alternatives such as entropy (gain ratio). We apply a comprehensive empirical evaluation framework testing against commonly used sampling and ensemble methods, considering performance across 58 varied datasets. We demonstrate the superiority (using robust tests of statistical significance) of HDDT on imbalanced data, as well as its competitive performance on balanced datasets. We thereby arrive at the particularly practical conclusion that for imbalanced data it is sufﬁcient to use Hellinger trees with bagging (BG) without any sampling methods. We provide all the datasets and software for this paper online (http://www. nd.edu/{\textasciitilde}dial/hddt).},

	abstract = {Hellinger Distance (HD) is a splitting metric that has been shown to have an excellent performance for imbalanced classification problems for methods based on Bagging of trees, while also showing good performance for balanced problems. Given that Random Forests (RF) use Bagging as one of two fundamental techniques to create diversity in the ensemble, it could be expected that HD is also effective for this ensemble method. The main aim of this article is to carry out an extensive investigation on important aspects about the use of HD in RF, including handling of multi-class problems, hyper-parameter optimization, metrics comparison, probability estimation, and metrics combination. In particular, HD is compared to other commonly used splitting metrics (Gini and Gain Ratio) in several contexts: balanced/imbalanced and two-class/multi-class. Two aspects related to classification problems are assessed: classification itself and probability estimation. HD is defined for two-class problems, but there are several ways in which it can be extended to deal with multi-class and this article studies the performance of the available options. Finally, even though HD can be used as an alternative to other splitting metrics, there is no reason to limit RF to use just one of them. Therefore, the final study of this article is to determine whether selecting the splitting metric using cross-validation on the training data can improve results further. Results show HD to be a robust measure for RF, with some weakness for balanced multi-class datasets (especially for probability estimation). Combination of metrics is able to result in a more robust performance. However, experiments of HD with text datasets show Gini to be more suitable than HD for this kind of problems.},

In the extreme case, it builds totally randomized trees whose structures are independent of the output values of the learning sample. The strength of the randomization can be tuned to problem speciﬁcs by the appropriate choice of a parameter. We evaluate the robustness of the default choice of this parameter, and we also provide insight on how to adjust it in particular situations. Besides accuracy, the main strength of the resulting algorithm is computational efﬁciency. A bias/variance analysis of the Extra-Trees algorithm is also provided as well as a geometrical and a kernel characterization of the models induced.},

This and its QGIS Python API makes it a perfect candidate for console-based geoprocessing. By establishing an interface, the R package RQGIS makes it possible to use QGIS as a geoprocessing workhorse from within R. Compared to other packages building a bridge to GIS (e.g., rgrass7, RSAGA, RPyGeo), RQGIS offers a wider range of geoalgorithms, and is often easier to use due to various convenience functions.

	doi = {10.1016/j.foreco.2019.117823},
	abstract = {Tree diameter increment (ΔDBH) is a key component of a forest growth and yield model as predictions are passed to other submodels and tree-level estimates are scaled up to represent plot- and stand-level measures. A common problem faced in mixed-species stands is that ΔDBH needs to be characterized for numerous species, each with varying growth rates, shade tolerances, and competitive abilities. In addition, a variety of approaches have been used to model ΔDBH with unclear implications for general suitability for each species and overall prediction accuracy. This analysis used remeasurement data comprising 2,656,354 observations from 16,204 permanent sample plots across the Acadian Forest region of North America to develop and compare alternative approaches to estimating ΔDBH as well as stem basal area increment (ΔBA). Sixty-one species or genera including several with N {\textless} 10 were represented where observed mean growth rates ranged from 0 to 1.08 cm yr−1, depending on species. Analyzing several modeling approaches to project DBH of the 15 most abundant species using various evaluation statistics to quantify prediction performance, this study showed that i) modeling ΔDBH was generally superior compared to approaches that estimated ΔBA, ii) a two-stage modeling procedure predicting potential growth and a corresponding multiplicative modifier to derive ultimate increment was mostly inferior compared to strategies predicting realized ΔDBH or ΔBA in a unified model form, and iii) species-specific, realized increment models exhibited similar behavior and accuracy compared to models fitted with modeling species as random effect. These key findings became even more evident when projection lengths increased (≥ 30 years). Our study thus showed the efficiency and flexibility of diameter predictions by including tree species as a random effect to account for ΔDBH differences of trees in mixed-species stands, including infrequent species. However, curves for rare species derived with the mixed effects modeling approach still need to be evaluated for biological plausibility as unbalanced or biased data can lead to uncharacteristic and potentially illogical behavior. Overall, the study highlights the challenges of accurately predicting ΔDBH across a range of species and conditions, but offers a general framework for future analyses in mixed species forests.},

	abstract = {The expected growth of the human population to about 11 billion sometime within the next rotation of most northern temperate forest crops will put greatly increased and varied demands on today's forested lands. Development of the timber resources on those lands that remain dedicated to timber production must be demonstrably sustainable if forest management is to help arrest rather than aggravate the continuing deterioration of the global environment, and if managed forests are to be a carbon sink rather than a carbon source with respect to the global "green-house effect". Unfortunately, the experience-based models traditionally used by foresters cannot make accurate predictions of future forest growth, yield, and carbon balance for the altered growing conditions that are expected to accompany this increase in human numbers. These tools are therefore unsuitable as a means of assessing the sustainability of site productivity under current or anticipated future forest management practices and the expected future soil, climate, and biotic conditions. It is time for foresters around the world to confront this issue and to develop and use more ecologically-sensitive, ecosystem-level stand growth and yield models.Knowledge-based, process-simulation stand growth models have many theoretical advantages, and are the only way of predicting future forest growth and carbon budgets on a particular site in the absence of accurate data on the past growth of forests on that site. However, such models have generally had significant practical limitations as an alternative to traditional forest yield models. They have either been too simple, or, if sufficiently complex, have had unacceptably large calibration data requirements, which has limited their portability. This has restricted most process-based simulation models to research and educational applications.An alternative approach which combines both the experience-based and the knowledge-based approaches offers a more practical alternative. The combination of "historical bioassay" and process-based modelling approaches into "hybrid simulation" stand models can provide a means by which to rank the most probable outcomes and the sustainability of alternative stand-level management strategies under a variety of possible future growing conditions.The accuracy of most forest management and forest economics models ultimately depends on the accuracy of stand-level growth models. As the world experiences increasing problems of air pollution (acid rain and the greenhouse effect), soil degradation, and deforestation, there is an urgent need for foresters to use ecosystem-level growth models that are sensitive to human-induced and naturally caused environmental changes. Use of such models is a necessary prerequisite to good stewardship of forest land and our legacy to future generations.},

Levin of Princeton University to calibrate, test, and analyze models of heterogeneous forested landscapes containing a diverse array of habitats. The project is an extension of previous, NASA-supported research to develop a spatially-explicit model of forest dynamics at the scale of an individual forest stand . That model  has been thoroughly parameterized from field studies in the modal upland environment of western Connecticut. Under our current funding, we are scaling-up the model and parameterizing it for the broad range of upland environments in the region. Our most basic goal is to understand the linkages between stand-level dynamics  and landscape-level dynamics of forest composition and structure.},
